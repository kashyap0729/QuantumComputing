1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:14,880
PROFESSOR: We'll begin by discussing
the wave packets and uncertainty.

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:22,500
So it's our first look into this Heisenberg
uncertainty relationships.

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:31,600
And to begin with, let's focus it as fixed
time, t equals zero.

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,809
So we'll work with packets at t equals zero.

5
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:43,731
And I will write a particular wave function
that you may have at t equals 0, and it's

6
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:50,719
a superposition of plane waves.

7
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,180
So it would be e to the ikx.

8
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:02,039
You sum over many of them, so you're going
to sum over k, but you're going to do it with

9
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,990
a weight, and that's 5k.

10
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:16,869
And there's a lot to learn about this, but
the physics that is encoded here is that any

11
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:28,649
wave at time equals 0, this psi of x at time
equals 0, can be written as a superposition

12
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:34,219
of states with momentum h bar k.

13
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:44,179
You remember e to the ikx represents a particle
or a wave that carries momentum h bar k.

14
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:52,370
So this whole idea here of a general wave
function being written in this way carries

15
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,859
physical meaning for us.

16
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:03,840
It's a quantum mechanical meaning, the fact
that this kind of wave has momentum.

17
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:15,610
But this phi of k, however, suppose you know
this wave function at time equals 0.

18
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,280
Phi of k is then calculable.

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,910
Phi of k can be determined, and that's the
foundation of what's called Fourier's theorem,

20
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,310
that gives you a formula for phi of k.

21
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,490
And it's a very similar formula.

22
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:39,840
1 over 2 pi, this time an integral over x.

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:50,110
So you take this of psi of x0 that you know
and then multiply by e to the minus ikx.

24
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:57,470
Integrate over x, and out comes this function
of k.

25
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:06,060
So if you know phi of x0, you know phi of
k.

26
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:13,270
You can calculate this interval and you can
rewrite phi of x0 as a superposition of plane

27
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,790
waves.

28
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,790
So that's how you would do a Fourier representation.

29
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:26,460
So somebody can give you an initial wave function,
and maybe it's a sine function or a Gaussian

30
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:34,400
or something, then what you would do if you
wanted to rewrite it in this way, is calculate

31
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,650
phi of k, because you know this psi, you can
calculate this integral, at least with a computer.

32
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,820
And once you know phi of k, you have a way
of writing psi as a superposition of plane

33
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,930
waves.

34
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:58,329
So we've talked about this before, because
we were doing wave packets before and we got

35
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:04,550
some intuition about how you form a wave packet
and how it moves.

36
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:10,940
Now we didn't put the time dependence here,
but that can wait.

37
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:22,330
What I wish to explain now is how by looking
at these expressions, you can understand the

38
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:31,460
uncertainties that you find on the wave function,
position, and momentum uncertainties, how

39
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,650
they are related.

40
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:39,670
So that is our real goal, understanding the
role of uncertainties here.

41
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:48,240
If phi of k has some uncertainty, how is the
uncertainty in psi determined?

42
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,150
So that's what we're looking for.

43
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,350
So relationship of uncertainties.

44
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:06,770
Now as before, we will take a phi of k, that
we've usually be in writing, that depends

45
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:13,640
on k and it's centered around some value k0.

46
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,670
It's some sort of nice, centered function.

47
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:26,410
And it has then, we say, some uncertainty
in the value of the momentum.

48
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:34,530
That is this signal, this phi of k that we're
using to produce this packet.

49
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:42,320
It has some uncertainty, it's not totally
sharp, it's peaked around k0 but not fully

50
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,420
sharp.

51
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:51,980
So the uncertainty is called delta k and it's
some typical width over here.

52
00:05:51,980 --> 00:06:00,970
Delta k is then uncertainty.

53
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,700
Now it's not the purpose of today's lecture
to make a precise definition of what the uncertainty

54
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,700
is.

55
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,080
This will come later.

56
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,650
At this moment, you just want to get the picture
and the intuition of what's going on.

57
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:21,500
And there is some uncertainty here, perhaps
you would say, look at those points where

58
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:29,150
the wave goes from peak value to half value
and see what is the width.

59
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,620
That's a typical uncertainty.

60
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,909
So all what we're going to do in these arguments
is get for you the intuition.

61
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:43,670
Therefore, the factors of 2 are not trustable.

62
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:49,120
If you're trying to make a precise statement,
you must do precise definitions.

63
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,650
And that will come later, probably in about
one or two lectures.

64
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,490
So at this moment, that's the uncertainty,
delta k.

65
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:11,419
And let's assume that this phi of k is real.

66
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:18,540
And its peaked around k0 uncertainty delta
k.

67
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:25,010
Now what happens with psi of x?

68
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:33,480
Well, we had our statements about the stationary
phase that you already are practicing with

69
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,050
them for this homework.

70
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:46,050
If you want to know where this function peaks,
you must look where the phase, this phi--

71
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,830
we say it's real, so it doesn't contribute
to the phase-- where the phase, which is here,

72
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:59,820
is stationary, given the condition that it
should happen at k0.

73
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,180
The only contribution to the integral is basically
around k0.

74
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,870
So in order to get something, you must have
a stationary phase, and the phase must be

75
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,320
stationary as a function of k, because you're
integrating over k.

76
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:27,640
And the phase is kx, the derivative with respect
to k of the face is just x, and that must

77
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:36,459
vanish, therefore, so you expect this to be
peaked around x equals zero.

78
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:52,170
So the x situation, so psi of x0 peaks at
x equals 0.

79
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,600
And so you have a picture here.

80
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,980
And if I have a picture, I would say, well
it peaks around the x equals 0.

81
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,839
So OK, it's like that.

82
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,360
And here we're going to have some uncertainty.

83
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:19,660
Here is psi of x and 0, and here is x.

84
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:28,269
And let me mention, I've already become fairly
imprecise here.

85
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:33,319
If you were doing this, you probably would
run into trouble.

86
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:40,519
I've sort of glossed over a small complication
here.

87
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:48,029
The complication is that this, when I talk
about the peaking of psi, and you probably

88
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:57,680
have seen it already, you have to worry whether
psi is real or psi is complex.

89
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,920
So what is this psi here?

90
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,709
Should it be real?

91
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:08,699
Well actually, it's not real.

92
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:15,540
You've done, perhaps, in the homework already
these integrals, and you see that psi is not

93
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,540
real.

94
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:23,029
So when we say it peaks at x equals 0, how
am I supposed to plot psi?

95
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:27,720
Am I plotting the real part, the imaginary
part, the absolute value?

96
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:38,230
So it's reasonable to plot the absolute value
and to say that psi absolute value peaks at

97
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,010
x equals 0.

98
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:52,420
And there will be some width again here, delta
x, width.

99
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:58,410
And that's the uncertainty in psi of x.

100
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:06,709
So the whole point of our discussion for the
next 10 minutes is to just try to determine

101
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:12,429
the relation between delta k and delta x and
understand it intuitively.
