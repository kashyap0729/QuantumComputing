1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
PROFESSOR: I've put on the
blackboard here the things

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,460
we were doing last time.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,510
We began our study
of stationary states

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,160
that are not normalizable.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,790
These are scattering states.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,580
Momentum eigenstates
were not normalizable,

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,180
but now we have more
interesting states that

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:28,080
represent the solutions of
the Schrodinger equation, that

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,500
are stationary states
with some energy e.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,690
Because they are
not normalizable,

11
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:39,030
but we cannot directly
interpret any of these solutions

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,880
as the behavior of a particle.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,750
I kind of tell you a story, OK.

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,230
So this is-- a particle
is coming, colliding,

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,520
doing something.

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,310
These are not
normalizable states.

17
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,860
So part of what we're going
to be trying to do today

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,520
is connect to the
picture of wave packets

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,360
and see how this is
used to really calculate

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,050
what would happen if you send
in a particle of potential.

21
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,150
Nevertheless, we
wrote a solution

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,340
that has roughly that
interpretation, at least

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,090
morally speaking.

24
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,640
We think of a wave that is
coming from the left, that's

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,410
ae to the ikx.

26
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,420
Now, in order to
have a wave, you

27
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,970
would have to have
time dependents,

28
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,860
and this is a
stationary solution.

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,490
And there is some
time dependents.

30
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:36,570
There is exponential of e to
the minus iet over h bar, where

31
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,220
e is the energy.

32
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,100
So this could be
added here to produce

33
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,280
the full stationary
state psi of x and t.

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,160
But we'll leave it understood--
it's a common phase

35
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,080
factor for both the
solutions of x less than 0,

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,910
and x greater than 0, because
the whole solution represents

37
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,130
a single solution.

38
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,630
It's not like a
solution on the left

39
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,796
and a solution on the right.

40
00:02:03,796 --> 00:02:09,270
It's a single solution
over all of x 4 a psi that

41
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,890
has some definite energy.

42
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,210
So we looked at the
conditions of continuity

43
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,680
of the wave function
and continuity

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,230
of the derivative of the
wave function, at x equals 0.

45
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,310
Those were two conditions.

46
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,680
And they gave you
this expression

47
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,450
for the ratios of c
over a and b over a.

48
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,330
We could even imagine, since
we can't normalize this,

49
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,340
setting a equal to 1, And.

50
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,390
Then calculating b and
c from those numbers.

51
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,280
We have two case a k in a k bar.

52
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,360
The k is relevant to the wave
function for x less than 0.

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,670
The k bar is relevant
for x greater than 0.

54
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,110
And they have to be different
because this represents

55
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,660
a DeBroglie wavelength, and
the DeBroglie wavelength

56
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,050
encodes the momentum
of the particle,

57
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,760
and the momentum of the
particle that we imagine here

58
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,220
classically is
different here where

59
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,330
this has this much kinetic
energy, and in the region

60
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,000
on the right, where
the particle only has

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,370
a much smaller kinetic energy.

62
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,220
So that's represented by k bar.

63
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,700
And k bar, being the
energy proportional

64
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,100
to the energy minus v 0, while
k squared has just the energy,

65
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,230
it's smaller than k.

66
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,650
So this is what we did.

67
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,230
We essentially
solved the problem,

68
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,480
and this qualifies
as a solution,

69
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,260
but we still haven't learned
anything very interesting

70
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,610
from it.

71
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,100
We have to understand
more what's going on.

72
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,700
And one thing we can do is
think of a particular limit.

73
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:06,440
The limit, or the case,
when e is equal to v 0,

74
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,410
exactly equal to
b 0, what happens?

75
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,390
Well, k bar would be equal to 0.

76
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:24,600
And if k bar is
equal to 0, you're

77
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,200
going to have just the
constant c in here.

78
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,200
But if k bar is
equal to 0, first b

79
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:41,450
is equal to a, because then it's
k over k, so b is equal to a.

80
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,060
And c is equal to 2a.

81
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,650
And the solution would
become psi of x equals--

82
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,290
well, a is equal to b.

83
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:07,930
So this is twice a cosine
of kx, when a equal to b

84
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,335
is a common factor, call it a.

85
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:13,490
And this thing is the
sum of two exponentials

86
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,570
with opposite signs.

87
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,040
That gives you the cosine.

88
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,008
And for c, you have 2a.

89
00:05:22,008 --> 00:05:25,720
And since k bar is equal
to 0, well, it's just 2a.

90
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,360
It's a number.

91
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,740
This is unnormalizable, but
even the original solution

92
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,050
is unnormalizable,
so we wouldn't

93
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,550
worry too much about it.

94
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:41,850
So how does that
look for x over here?

95
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,200
You have a cosine
of kx, so it's going

96
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,420
to be doing this to the left.

97
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,660
That's for x less than 0.

98
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,380
And at this point,
it goes like that.

99
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,620
Just flat side
effects, and here's 2a.

100
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,290
so there's nothing wrong with
the solution in this case.

101
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,680
It's kind of a little strange
that it becomes a constant,

102
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,060
but perfectly OK.

103
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,220
What really helps
you here is to find

104
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:30,630
some conditions that express
the conservation of probability.

105
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:36,060
You see, you have a
stationary state solution.

106
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,960
Now, stationary states
are funny states.

107
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,280
They're not static states,
completely static states.

108
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,070
For example, if you have a
loop, and you have a current

109
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,060
that never changes in time.

110
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,800
This is a stationary condition,
even in electromagnetism.

111
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,280
So what we imagine
here is that we're

112
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,500
going to have some current,
probability current,

113
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:08,430
that is coming from the
left, and some of it

114
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,670
maybe bounces back, and
some of it goes forward.

115
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:22,640
But essentially, if you think
of the barrier, whatever--

116
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,890
you look a little to
the left of the barrier

117
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,810
and a little to the
right of the barrier.

118
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,300
Whatever is coming in, say,
must be going out there,

119
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,260
because probability cannot
increase in this region.

120
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,620
It would be like saying that
the particle suddenly requires

121
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,815
larger and larger
probability to be

122
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:44,870
in this portion of the graph.

123
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,980
And that can't happen.

124
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,920
So probabilistic
current gives you

125
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,960
a way to quantify some of the
things that are happening.

126
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:07,020
So probability current
plus j effects,

127
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:15,180
which was h bar over m,
imaginary part of psi star

128
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,470
d psi dx.

129
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,160
So let's compute the
probability current.

130
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,820
Let's compute for x less than 0.

131
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,510
What is the probability
current j of x?

132
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:39,720
We then call it the probability
current on the left side.

133
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,140
I would have to substitute
the value of the wave function

134
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,690
for x less than 0, which
is the top line there,

135
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,610
into this formula.

136
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,200
And see what is the current.

137
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,240
In fact, I believe you've
done that in an exercise

138
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,860
some time ago.

139
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,470
And as you can
imagine, the current

140
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:06,040
is proportional to the
modulus of a squared,

141
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,250
the length of a squared,
the length of b squared also

142
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:10,780
enters.

143
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,940
And the funny thing is,
between those two waves,

144
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,630
one that is going to the right
and one is going to the left,

145
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,690
that that's very
visible in the current.

146
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:26,328
This is h bar k over m.

147
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:31,620
A squared minus b squared.

148
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,820
It's a short computation, and it
might be an OK and a good idea

149
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,650
to do it again.

150
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,890
It was done in the homework.

151
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,015
And x greater than 0.

152
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:54,100
J right of x would be
equal to h bar k bar.

153
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,510
Now that, you can almost
do it in your head.

154
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,670
This c into the ik bar x.

155
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,470
Look what's happening.

156
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,200
From psi star you get a c star.

157
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,070
From psi you get the c, so
that's going to be a c squared.

158
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:13,060
The face is going in a
cancel between the one here

159
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,870
and the one on psi,
but the derivative

160
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,800
will bring down an ik bar,
and the imaginary part of that

161
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,120
is just k bar.

162
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,000
So the answer is this.

163
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,470
And these are the two currents.

164
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:37,040
Now, if we are doing
things correctly,

165
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,860
the two currents
should be the same.

166
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,580
Whatever current
exists to the left,

167
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,500
say a positive current that
is coming in, to the right

168
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,820
must be the same.

169
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,310
Another pleasant thing
is that this current

170
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,750
doesn't depend on the value
of x, as x is less than 0.

171
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:01,250
Nor of the value of x
when x is greater than 0.

172
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,080
And that's good
for conservation.

173
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,390
It would be pretty
bad as well, if you

174
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,770
look at two places
for x less than 0,

175
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,990
and you find that the
current is not the same.

176
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,860
So where is it accumulating?

177
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,720
What's going on?

178
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,670
So the independence
of these things--

179
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:26,010
from x, this is
constant, and a constant

180
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,140
is very important, because this
constant should be the same.

181
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:35,110
Now, whether or not about
current conservation,

182
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,860
it's encoded in
Schrodinger's equation.

183
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,330
And we solved
Schrodinger's equation.

184
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:46,090
That's how we got these
relations between b, a and c

185
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,990
So it better be that these
two things are the same.

186
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,250
So Jay elsewhere--
jl, for example.

187
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,500
I won't put off x,
because it's just clear.

188
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,522
It doesn't depend on x.

189
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:08,900
1 minus b over a
squared a squared.

190
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,850
I'm starting to
manipulate the left one,

191
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,130
and see if indeed the
currents are the same.

192
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:25,520
And now, I get h bar k over m.

193
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,400
1 minus b over a squared.

194
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,820
I put the modulus squared,
but so far everything

195
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,740
is real in this--

196
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,220
k, k bar, b, a, c--

197
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,430
all real.

198
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,310
Is that right?

199
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,610
No complex numbers there.

200
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,160
So I don't have to
be that careful.

201
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:51,300
B over a squared is
k minus k bar over k

202
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:58,880
plus k bar squared a squared.

203
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,320
And I gfit that here, maybe.

204
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,250
H bar k over m.

205
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,020
Now what?

206
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,540
This is squared,
so the si, squared

207
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,440
passes here to the numerator
minus the difference squared,

208
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:23,470
that's going to be
a 4k k bar over k

209
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,775
plus k bar squared a squared.

210
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:39,210
And yes, this seems to
be working quite well.

211
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:45,490
Flip these k's-- these
two k's, flip them around.

212
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,530
So the answer for
jl so far is h bar,

213
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,830
now k bar, because
I flipped that, m,

214
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,610
and now I would have 4 k
squared over this thing, which

215
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:08,310
is 2k over k plus k bar
squared of a squared.

216
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:14,230
And this quantity,
if I remember right,

217
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:21,550
is just c squared, as
you can see from there.

218
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:30,550
So indeed, this is j
right, and it worked out.

219
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,880
This is j right.

220
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,640
So j left is equal to j right
by current conservation.

221
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,900
So that's nice.

222
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,240
That's another way
of getting insight

223
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,900
into these coefficients.

224
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,010
And that kind of
thing that makes you

225
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:57,300
feel that there's no
chance you got this wrong.

226
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,690
It all works well.
