1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
PROFESSOR: What
is a Rydberg atom?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:11,520
Well, it's a-- an atom can be
a Rydberg atom if the outermost

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,860
electron is in a very high
principal quantum number.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,560
That's a definition
of a Rydberg atom.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,270
The last electron is an n--

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,880
little n, very large.

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,530
Now that is very
interesting because when

8
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,400
that happens, Rydberg atoms--

9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:49,300
when that happens, you have
a nucleus with charge ze

10
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,640
and you have lots of electrons.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,600
And the last electron--
suppose the last electrode

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,900
is in an orbit further out.

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,379
You see the orbits do become
further out in general.

14
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,250
And suppose the last electron
is in some large value

15
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,680
of little n, so
it's somewhat out.

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,070
So here is the last electron.

17
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,500
This electron sees a
nucleus with charge z,

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,050
but it also sees z
minus 1 electrons, all

19
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,370
the other electrons.

20
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,060
The last electron is outside
the nucleus and the cloud

21
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,590
of the other electrons.

22
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:45,740
So the last electron sees
a charge plus 1 z from here

23
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:54,210
and z minus 1 of the electrons.

24
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,020
So the last electron
sees charge 1.

25
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,690
So in some sense, to
a good approximation,

26
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:07,250
the last electron says, oh,
there's a hydrogen atom here.

27
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,350
I'm part of a hydrogen atom.

28
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,820
I don't see my friends.

29
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,900
The other electrons are
too close to the nucleus.

30
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:20,370
And I'm out there going
around as if I were hydrogen.

31
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,540
So that's a very nice
application of hydrogen atoms.

32
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:32,340
So the first question that
we want to understand,

33
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,450
that it's, again conceptually,
is what is the size.

34
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:44,795
If n is large what is
the size of the atom?

35
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,770
Now I must say, I
myself, when I look

36
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,830
at these things
after a few years

37
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,460
that I don't teach quantum
mechanics, I look at here

38
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,910
and say, OK, this
is the solution.

39
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,820
Well, maybe the size is na0.

40
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,150
Unfortunately, that's
completely wrong.

41
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,070
And we're going to
try to explain what

42
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,690
was wrong in looking there.

43
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,600
You know, you see your
hydrogen atom wave function.

44
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,710
There's nothing like
really the size,

45
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,940
there's no such precise
definition as the size.

46
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,560
But you could say, what's the
expected value of the radius.

47
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,470
That's a reasonable
definition of size.

48
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,930
And you know from
this wave function,

49
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:56,440
is going to come out to a0, a0
over 2, 2a0, maybe pi over 2a0.

50
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,520
Something like that.

51
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,470
So from here you
would say, well,

52
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,780
it's going to come out to pi
and na0 or something like that.

53
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,490
That is not true.

54
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:11,500
So how do we see
that it's not true?

55
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,500
We'll take a little
time in a few minutes.

56
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,670
But how can we get
the size of that atom

57
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,100
correctly in an intuitive way?

58
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,700
Again, we want to
just understand

59
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,220
a few results
about hydrogen atom

60
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,750
that become part
of your intuition.

61
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,285
So the important result
here is the virial theorem.

62
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,450
Now whenever I think of
the virial theorem I say,

63
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,750
oh, there was a factor
of 2 or a 1/2 there.

64
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,560
How did it go?

65
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:58,365
It takes me a few seconds to try
to reconstruct that it's this.

66
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,590
For the hydrogen system,
for any 1 over r potential,

67
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,230
there is this relation
within the expectation

68
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,160
value of the kinetic energy,
the potential energy.

69
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,200
You've seen that result
probably a couple of times

70
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,550
already in this course.

71
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,070
Because it's a real
important result.

72
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,920
It looks like OK, just a
theorem about these things.

73
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,330
But the intuition
is really important.

74
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,280
So how does one remember
or picture that?

75
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,930
One way is the following.

76
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,800
And that's the way I like it.

77
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,620
I imagine the energy line here.

78
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,570
And here is 0.

79
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,980
And the one thing I
remember is that, yes,

80
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:52,930
there is a kinetic energy here.

81
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,480
And actually the
bound state energy

82
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,390
is exactly the same,
but the opposite.

83
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,320
That's a way to remember that.

84
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,240
That's really what is going on.

85
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,500
That's the key thing.

86
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,710
The kinetic energy and
the bound state energy

87
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,120
are just of opposite signs.

88
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,730
Why do we see that?

89
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,350
Because then we have that
V, from this equation,

90
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,880
is minus 2T.

91
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:37,720
And if V is minus 2T, means
that T plus V is T minus 2T.

92
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,620
And T plus V is
the total energy.

93
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:49,610
So T plus V is equal
to the total energy

94
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,750
E of the bound state.

95
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,340
For any stationary
state, this is true.

96
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:04,910
And this thing, given this
condition, is minus T.

97
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,630
So that's the way
we think of it.

98
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:16,350
So we then have a nice result
because the expectation value

99
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:27,510
of the potential would then be
minus 2 times the expectation

100
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:37,510
value of T, which is
itself minus the energy.

101
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:42,420
So you have a minus 2
times minus the energy.

102
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,020
And it's equal to the energy.

103
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,070
And this is correct.

104
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,630
The expectation value
of V is the energy

105
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,140
and the expectation
value of Eb is negative,

106
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,180
and the energy's negative.

107
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,140
So what is this?

108
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:06,330
This is the expectation value
of minus e squared over r.

109
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,030
In fact, of-- yeah,
I'll leave it like that.

110
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,110
So I'm back to z
equal 1, because we're

111
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,710
talking about Rydberg atoms.

112
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,370
Oh, 2Eb, I'm sorry, here.

113
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,420
Thank you.

114
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,590
OK, so expectation value of
the potential we have here.

115
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,590
And 2 times the energy--

116
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,240
yeah, I would have
gotten this wrong.

117
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,570
Thanks for correcting
it before it

118
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,280
did damage to the derivation.

119
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:48,100
We have it there, e squared
over 2a0, 1 over n squared.

120
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,730
So what can we cancel?

121
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,870
Well, the 2's cancel.

122
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,670
The e squares cancel.

123
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,920
The signs cancel.

124
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,080
And we get expectation
value of 1 over r

125
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:12,680
is equal to 1 over
n squared a0, which

126
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:20,830
is suggesting very clearly that
the typical radius is not na0.

127
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,220
It's n square a0.

128
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,870
So this is exact.

129
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,000
The virial theorem is exact.

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,200
The energy is exact.

131
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,570
This is exact.

132
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,720
That's not quite the
expectation value of r.

133
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,260
The expectation
value of r is not

134
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,410
the inverse of the
expectation value of 1 over r.

135
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,260
It's somewhat related.

136
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,330
But there's no theorem,
because it would be false,

137
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:56,110
that the expectation value
of 1 over a random variable

138
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,644
is the expectation value of--

139
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:03,750
is 1 over the expectation
value of the random variable.

140
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,240
It's just not true.

141
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,380
This nice result for 1
over r is exactly true.

142
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,480
And it's l independent.

143
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:22,650
On the other hand, the
expectation value of r

144
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,630
can be calculated with
a bit more effort--

145
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,700
a lot more effort.

146
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,660
And it's equal to this.

147
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,720
It's just the same thing and
1, with a little correction,

148
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,635
which is 1/2 1 minus l times
l plus 1 over n squared.

149
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,550
So actually, the expectation
value of r in the hydrogen atom

150
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,010
is l dependent.

151
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,290
Not terribly strongly l
dependent, but somewhat l

152
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,460
dependent.

153
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:10,180
To get an idea, this is equal
to n squared a0 times 3/2

154
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,790
for l equals 0.

155
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,680
When l is equal to 0, you see
this whole bracket becomes 3/2.

156
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:30,920
And for the maximum l, l equals
n minus 1, this is roughly 1.

157
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,780
This is roughly 0, to a good
approximation but not exactly.

158
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,920
It becomes n squared
a0 with corrections

159
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,790
that are very, very small.

160
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,364
It's pretty accurate.

161
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,880
All right.

162
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,360
So, first thing we've
learned is that we

163
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,250
got a radius, expected radius,
that goes back n squared a0.

164
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,680
So it's kind of
interesting to see

165
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,830
what went wrong if
you would have thought

166
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,470
with a form of the solution.

167
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:20,395
So psi nlm equal Ar to
the l Wnl, a polynomial,

168
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:28,360
e to the minus r over
na0 Ylm of theta and phi

169
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:37,840
or fnl of r times Ylm
of the solid angle.

170
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,490
And what do we know
about this polynomial?

171
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:49,430
It's of degree n minus l plus 1.

172
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,130
That's it.

173
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,705
And it depends on r.

174
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,840
So what we're looking at is
what was the error in thinking

175
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,130
that the typical r was na0.

176
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,560
And you see, when you
make a mistake like this--

177
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,630
the mistake I made of saying
oh, na0 must be right--

178
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,350
and you find that it's
wrong, it's very important

179
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,420
to go back and learn why did
you get the wrong answer.

180
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,240
That's what we're doing now.

181
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,170
So the one question
I can ask to begin

182
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,000
with is what is a
probability density

183
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,470
to find the electron between
some radius r and a radius r

184
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:49,850
plus dr. So, you know,
this is a probability.

185
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,290
And it depends on theta and phi.

186
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,740
And it's very complicated.

187
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,460
How about giving
me a probability

188
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,020
along r that they can
integrate along r and visualize

189
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,270
how this is dependant on r?

190
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:09,980
So the probability to find
the electron in this shell

191
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:17,260
must be equal to the value
of the wave function squared

192
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,220
times the volume element.

193
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,500
And the volume
element here is psi

194
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,480
squared r squared dr times--

195
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,580
you would say 4 pi, but it's
not spherically symmetric.

196
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:41,120
So you have to integrate
over solid angle.

197
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,130
That is the volume element.

198
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,920
And since I have to
integrate over solid angle,

199
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,650
I must have psi squared here.

200
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,120
So that's the right equation.

201
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,510
If you want to make
things look perfect,

202
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,150
put the d cubed x before
the psi squared here.

203
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,700
And the problem is
that the d cubed

204
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:09,080
x is big enough that it, in some
sense, has partial integrals.

205
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,450
The So notation is not
perfect, but somehow you

206
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,090
must imagine this
whole volume element

207
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:24,660
that is still infinitesimal but
involves some integral already.

208
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,370
So you have this.

209
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:37,030
And you get then r
squared dr fnl squared

210
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:43,158
and you have the integral, the
omega of this Y star lm Ylm.

211
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:52,120
And that integral is exactly 1.

212
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,020
Spherical harmonics
are normalized.

213
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,330
So now I can cancel
the dr. And I

214
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,680
get that the radial
probability distribution, which

215
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:12,105
is a nice concept, is really
r squared fnl of r squared.

216
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,940
Radial probability.

217
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:28,210
So our mistake-- my
mistake must have

218
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:34,780
been that I didn't include
all that was relevant.

219
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,760
The exponential is one part.

220
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,350
But there is the polynomial.

221
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,730
And the polynomial must
be causing the trouble.

222
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:50,780
Indeed, that's
what is happening.

223
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:58,300
Let's look at fnl from
the top blackboard.

224
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:05,579
That includes r to the
l times that polynomial.

225
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,200
And it's a polynomial
of that degree.

226
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:20,770
So it begins like a0 plus
up to coefficient a prime r

227
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:25,470
to the n minus l plus--

228
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,329
well, minus l minus 1.

229
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,370
And then I have the exponential.

230
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,920
OK.

231
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,120
Now I cannot do this--

232
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,440
I don't want to do this
calculation exactly.

233
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,710
It's too complicated.

234
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:57,580
So let's ignore the lower
part of the polynomial.

235
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,200
And we're thinking the radius
is going to be reasonably big.

236
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,090
So it's a reasonable
idea to keep

237
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:09,130
the power of the polynomial
that is the largest.

238
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,400
So what is the largest?

239
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,540
And here you see a
nice thing, actually r

240
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,360
to the l times this polynomial
is a polynomial that

241
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,860
begins with r to
the l and finishes

242
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,136
with r to the n minus 1.

243
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:31,980
So it has like equal
number of terms as reaches

244
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,020
a value of n minus 1.

245
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:39,090
The last term in the polynomial,
when you multiply it in,

246
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,990
this begins like r to
the l and the last term

247
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,040
is r to the n minus 1.

248
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,570
So let's take this
to be proportional

249
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:54,480
to r to the n minus 1
equal to minus r na0.

250
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,410
And here is the fight that
actually changes the answer.

251
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,370
Because this is fnl.

252
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:14,080
So actually I can write
p of r is proportional up

253
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,640
to a constant of normalization,
and the approximation

254
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:26,010
they have then r squared
times this polynomial squared.

255
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,490
But I'm taking the last
term of the polynomial,

256
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:34,820
so we get r to the 2n e
to the minus 2r over na0.

257
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,682
That's a probability
distribution.

258
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,990
And with this
probability distribution,

259
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,080
then you see what's
happening is that there

260
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,510
is a fight between
an exponential that

261
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:58,420
has a typical length where it
decays to half its value, that

262
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:03,700
is related to na0
but the maximum

263
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,170
is delayed because it's
multiplied by a function

264
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:13,630
that the higher the value of n,
the slower it is to take off.

265
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,920
x squared or r squared
takes off slower than r,

266
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,340
takes of slower
than r to the 4th.

267
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:27,250
So here you have a thing
that just grows like that,

268
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,550
but it takes
forever to take off.

269
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,920
And the result of this is a
function that just picks up

270
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,200
at some point over here.

271
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,300
And we want to find the maximum.

272
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:47,520
So the maximum comes
from taking a derivative.

273
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:55,590
So the maximum of p
of r is determined

274
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:00,690
by setting the derivative
of this equal to 0.

275
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:09,900
So you get 2n over r times
the same r to the 2n e

276
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,830
to the minus 22 over na0.

277
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,480
So the first term,
the derivative

278
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,460
is 2r and r to the 2n
minus 1, which is divided

279
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,220
by r and the same thing.

280
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,470
The second derivative
gives you minus 2 over na0.

281
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,350
And that's it.

282
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:41,670
So from these two you get that
n over r is equal to 1 over na0.

283
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:54,320
So r equals n squared
a0, as we had predicted.

284
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,690
So it's the interplay
of the polynomial

285
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:03,390
with the other thing that
makes the radius go very high.

286
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:10,170
So what about this
Rydberg atoms in nature?

287
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:14,930
Well, they've been observed
in interstellar gases.

288
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,500
You see, there was this
phenomenon of recombination

289
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:24,530
when protons captured electrons
as the universe cooled off,

290
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,800
and formed hydrogen atoms.

291
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,360
And that recombination
sometimes works in such a way

292
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,380
that the proton can
capture an electron.

293
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,160
And it captures it in a
very high quantum number.

294
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:46,970
And it keeps happening as
we observe this electron.

295
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:56,030
So people have observed in
astrophysics n equal 350.

296
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,790
And [INAUDIBLE] here the
electron being captured,

297
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:05,170
just not in the usual size but
almost a million times bigger.

298
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:12,970
So what happens for this
thing r is equal 0.53 times

299
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,930
10 to the minus 10 meters.

300
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,050
That's a0.

301
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:23,150
And then you have 350 squared.

302
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:27,023
And that gives you 6.5 microns.

303
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,750
That's actually pretty big.

304
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,340
A blood cell is 8 microns.

305
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:45,660
A red blood cell is 8 microns.

306
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,580
They are not stable because
eventually they spiral in.

307
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,090
But if you have an atom
that, for example, has

308
00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:00,630
an n equal to 5, it jumps
to n equals to 1 in 10

309
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,320
to the minus 7 seconds.

310
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,650
These atoms are rather stable.

311
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:08,670
Instead of lasting 1/10 of
a millionth of a second,

312
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:12,450
they can last a millisecond,
1/10 of a second,

313
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,300
sometimes even 1 second.

314
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,900
It takes a long time
to go down that spiral.

315
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:25,890
The energy levels-- if you have
energies that go like 1 over n

316
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:31,590
squared, the energy levels,
the separation between them,

317
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,720
goes like 1 over n cubed.

318
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,460
So lots and lots
of states there.

319
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,370
And it takes a long time for it
to decay from one to another.

320
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:47,680
So they observe them in
the lab in different ways.

321
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,720
They create them
with lasers now.

322
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,840
You have the outermost
electron, you kick it

323
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,980
to another orbit with one--

324
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,410
they use three lasers.

325
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,780
In the lab at MIT, three lasers.

326
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,200
One and two to kick
it to an n equal 10,

327
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,370
and then the third one to
kick it to n equals 60.

328
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:09,680
And they detect those
atoms by ionization.

329
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,590
A normal atom, you can't ionize.

330
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,060
You would need millions
of volts per centimeter

331
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,570
to ionize it with
an electric field.

332
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,140
These atoms you can
ionize very easily.

333
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,910
So they can see that they've
been created that way.

334
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:37,290
So also in terms of sizes,
the diameter of hair

335
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:41,010
is about 50 microns.

336
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,330
Hair is very thin.

337
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,340
But you see it.

338
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,240
So you're about a
factor of 5 or 10

339
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,140
to being able to see that
atom with your naked eye.

340
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,520
It's pretty impressive.

341
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,775
Incredible, in fact.

342
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:04,320
So a nice laboratory, those are
almost semi-classical atoms.

343
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,440
All what Bohr was
doing of calculating,

344
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,060
you can derive this
law by assuming

345
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:16,680
that the transitions between
orbits in the hydrogen atom

346
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,400
emit photons of the
right frequency.

347
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,180
It's all kinds of fun things.
