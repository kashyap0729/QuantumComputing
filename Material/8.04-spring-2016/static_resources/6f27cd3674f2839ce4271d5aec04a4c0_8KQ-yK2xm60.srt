1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,958
PROFESSOR: We start with
the stationary states.

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,340
In fact, stationary
states are going

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:19,550
to keep us quite busy for
probably a couple of weeks.

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,780
Because it's a place where you
get the intuition about solving

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,150
Schrodinger's equation.

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:37,600
So the stationary states are
simple and useful solutions

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,175
of the Schrodinger equation,
very nice and simple.

8
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:46,450
So what are they by definition?

9
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,131
Well, we begin
with a definition.

10
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:54,450
And the intuition of a
stationary state will follow.

11
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:00,200
See the word stationary
is not the same as static.

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,250
Stationary is something that
maybe it's kind of moving,

13
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,410
but things don't change.

14
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,280
Static is something
that's just not moving.

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,802
Stationary states
have time dependence.

16
00:01:14,802 --> 00:01:18,720
It is very simple,
as we will see.

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:31,335
So, your definition
of a stationary state

18
00:01:31,335 --> 00:01:43,635
has a factorized space
and time dependencies.

19
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:54,060
So this psi of x and t
is a stationary state.

20
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:02,860
If you can write it as a
product of a function of time

21
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,800
times a function of position.

22
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,242
And now, I will try to
be careful about this.

23
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:16,540
Wave functions that
have position and time

24
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,580
will have this
bar at the bottom.

25
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:25,920
Wave functions that don't
have x will not have it.

26
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,950
If I slip on that,
please let me know.

27
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:37,915
So this is a stationary
state, but a stationary state

28
00:02:37,915 --> 00:02:40,512
has factorized space
and time dependencies

29
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,697
and solves the Schrodinger
equation-- the solution

30
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:46,000
of Schrodinger's equation.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,290
So what we need to understand is
what this factorized dependence

32
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,350
tell us for the
Schrodinger equation.

33
00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:02,410
So this stationary state
has time dependence.

34
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,020
But the thing that
makes them stationary

35
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,160
is that if you look
at some observable,

36
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,940
a Hermitian operator,
and you say,

37
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,462
OK, the state has
time dependence,

38
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:17,040
so maybe my observable
will have time dependence.

39
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,404
No.

40
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:21,790
The observables don't
have time dependence.

41
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,280
That is the nice thing
about stationary states.

42
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:36,349
So, what we call time
independent observables which

43
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:40,050
are all observables that
are familiar [INAUDIBLE]--

44
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,160
Hamiltonian, the
momentum, the precision,

45
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,800
the angular momentum.

46
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:53,563
Time independent observables
have no time dependence.

47
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:02,158
And it kind of looks simple
when you write it like that.

48
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,581
Time independent means
don't have time dependence.

49
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:11,485
But you've seen that d
dt of the expectation

50
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:19,332
value of x is equal to p
over m, or the sum of p

51
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:21,742
over m, the velocity.

52
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:24,640
And here it is-- a time
independent observable

53
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,980
that does have time dependence.

54
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,310
So the observable
is time independent,

55
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,915
but expectation value
have no time dependence

56
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:44,020
in their expectation values.

57
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:52,610
The time dependence
comes from the state--

58
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,912
the state, the psi of x
and t have time dependence,

59
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:59,790
and sometimes it just
doesn't drop out.

60
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:06,790
But for stationary states, it
will drop, as you will see.

61
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,664
So, time independent observables
have no time dependence

62
00:05:10,664 --> 00:05:11,830
in their expectation values.

63
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,720
OK.

64
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,615
So enough of saying things.

65
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:19,230
And let's just get to them.

66
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,326
So we look at the
Schrodinger equation,

67
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:30,060
i h-bar d dt of
psi of x and t is

68
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,392
equal to h-bar psi of x and t.

69
00:05:34,392 --> 00:05:41,850
And just to remind, this minus
h squared over 2m d second d x

70
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:47,134
squared plus V of x.

71
00:05:47,134 --> 00:05:54,966
And I will consider states that
have just that at this moment.

72
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:04,447
Otherwise, it's not so easy
to get time-dependent--

73
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,430
to get stationary states.

74
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:12,100
If you have a potential
that has time dependence,

75
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,610
we kind of do the nice thing
that we're going to do.

76
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:20,420
So we're going to look only at
time independent potentials.

77
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:29,480
So, V of x, like this,
times psi of x and t.

78
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,150
OK.

79
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:35,090
So what we do next is
to simply substitute

80
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,424
the value of the wave function
into the differential equation

81
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:40,040
and see what we get.

82
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,400
So on the left
hand side, we will

83
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:50,834
get i h-bar The psi of x goes
out but you have d dt, Now

84
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:53,798
a normal derivative of g of t.

85
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:08,000
And now, this factor, H of
psi acts on these two things.

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,040
Imagine the function
of time times

87
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,431
the function of x sitting here.

88
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:16,200
Well, the function of
time can be moved out.

89
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,758
So the function of time can be
moved across the Hamiltonian

90
00:07:20,758 --> 00:07:21,674
operator.

91
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,752
It doesn't do anything to it.

92
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:34,430
So we'll have g of t times
H-hat of the psi of x.

93
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,410
This is H-hat.

94
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:48,420
And because we had
no time dependence

95
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,390
in the potential,
our assumption,

96
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,410
this whole thing
is a function of x.

97
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,826
All right.

98
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:03,700
Next step.

99
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:10,730
Divide this whole equation
by the total wave function.

100
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,210
Divide by psi.

101
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,850
Well, if you divide by psi,
you cancel the middle psi here,

102
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,500
and you get the 1 over g.

103
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:35,620
So you get i h-bar 1
over g dg dt is equal--

104
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:41,090
on the right side, you
cancel the g and you get a 1

105
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:52,002
over psi of x H-hat psi of x.

106
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:58,440
And now you look
at this equation.

107
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,171
And this equation is saying
something very strange.

108
00:09:03,171 --> 00:09:08,460
The left hand side is a
function of time only.

109
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,530
The right hand side is a
function of space only.

110
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:19,953
How can a function of time be
equal to a function of space?

111
00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:24,060
The only way this can
be is if both are not

112
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,020
a function of what they
were supposed to be.

113
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,740
They're just numbers.

114
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,671
Any function of time cannot be
equal to a function of space,

115
00:09:33,671 --> 00:09:34,613
in generality.

116
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:36,030
It just doesn't make sense.

117
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,765
So each side must be
equal to a constant,

118
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:41,280
and it's the same constant.

119
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,240
So each side, this is
all equal to a constant.

120
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:58,530
And we'll call the constant E.
And this E has units of energy.

121
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:11,872
E equal to be a real constant
with units of energy.

122
00:10:19,808 --> 00:10:22,907
You can see the units
because the Hamiltonian

123
00:10:22,907 --> 00:10:23,740
has units of energy.

124
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,683
And whatever psi units it has--

125
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:31,100
whatever every unit
psi has, they cancel.

126
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,177
Here, whatever units
g has, they cancel.

127
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:39,005
And h-bar over time
is units of energy,

128
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,900
like in energies
equal h-bar omega.

129
00:10:44,635 --> 00:10:46,170
So it has units of energy.

130
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,650
The only thing that you
may be could say, why real.

131
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,700
Quantum mechanics
loves complex numbers.

132
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,590
So why don't we
put the complex E?

133
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,956
We'll see what trouble
we get if you choose

134
00:11:00,956 --> 00:11:02,326
something that is complex.

135
00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:04,100
So here we go.

136
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,597
It's a real quantity
to be-- let's

137
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:09,270
do it real for the time being.

138
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,840
And let's solve
the first equation.

139
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:22,390
The left hand side, i h-bar dg
dt is now equal to gE, or E,

140
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:29,180
where E is a number and
g is a function of time

141
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,330
from where g of p is
equal to constant E

142
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:39,910
to the minus iEt over h-bar.

143
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:45,070
Let's just check
it works correctly.

144
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,480
It's a first order
differential equation.

145
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,510
Just one function
of integration.

146
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,815
If you guess the answer,
must be the answer.

147
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:58,070
And that's the time dependence
of a stationary state.

148
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,310
It's exponential
minus iEt over h-bar.

149
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,620
What about the other equation?

150
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:22,200
The other equation has become
H psi of x equals E psi of x.

151
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:28,402
Or, we should write at least
once, minus h squared over 2m--

152
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:30,266
did I make a mistake?

153
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:35,370
No, I didn't-- d
second dx squared--

154
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,220
I got this normal
derivatives here

155
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,760
because this is just
a function of x--

156
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:47,995
plus V of x psi is
equal to E psi of x.

157
00:12:47,995 --> 00:12:52,712
This is the same equation
that I'm boxing twice,

158
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:55,110
because it's written
in those two ways.

159
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,200
And both ways are
very important.

160
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,090
And this is part of solving
for stationary state.

161
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,256
You've solved for g of t.

162
00:13:06,256 --> 00:13:10,950
The time dependence
was easy to solve for,

163
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,842
but the x dependence is
complicated, in general.

164
00:13:13,842 --> 00:13:15,410
There, you have to do some work.

165
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,740
You have to solve a
differential equation.

166
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,440
It's not that easy.

167
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,250
So many people-- most people--

168
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,672
call this the time independent
Schrodinger equation.

169
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:48,890
So that's the time independent
Schrodinger equation,

170
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,590
where H psi equal E psi.

171
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,310
And as you can imagine, solving
this differential equation can

172
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,080
be challenging, or
sometimes very interesting

173
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,297
because it may be that, as
far as the first equation

174
00:14:04,297 --> 00:14:06,263
is concerned, of
what we did here,

175
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:09,161
we don't know what
this number E is.

176
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:13,374
But it may be that the
only reasonable solutions

177
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:18,192
that this equation has
are for some values of E.

178
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:21,560
The analogy with
matrices should tell you

179
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,180
that's probably what's
going to happen.

180
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,235
Because you remember eigenstates
and eigenvalues of matrices

181
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,635
are peculiar numbers.

182
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:35,000
If you have a matrix,
they're peculiar eigenvalues.

183
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,940
So this equation is an
eigenfunction equation.

184
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,960
And it's possible that
it has the solution

185
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,908
for some particular
values of the energy.

186
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:50,340
Let me write the
whole solution then.

187
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,400
If you've solved
these two things,

188
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,410
the whole solution
psi of x and t

189
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:05,450
is now a constant
times psi of x times

190
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:12,620
e to the minus iEt over
h-bar, where this psi of x

191
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,390
solves this equation.

192
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:20,505
So this is the stationary state.

193
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,980
How about normalizing
the stationary state?

194
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,230
Can we do that?

195
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,300
Well, if we try
to normalize it--

196
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:46,100
psi star of x and t
and psi of x and t dx,

197
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,560
and you set this equal to 1.

198
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,675
This should be the
case, because this

199
00:15:51,675 --> 00:15:55,410
should be interesting solutions
of the Schrodinger equation.

200
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,364
We expect that we could
do particles with them.

201
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:04,818
And we can start wave packets
or peculiar states with them.

202
00:16:04,818 --> 00:16:07,730
And let's see what we get here.

203
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:13,142
Maybe I should know.

204
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:15,610
I'm really [INAUDIBLE].

205
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:21,405
I'm going to erase
that constant C here.

206
00:16:21,405 --> 00:16:24,982
Since we want to
normalize this, we

207
00:16:24,982 --> 00:16:28,840
will think of this as
a normalization of psi.

208
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,837
When we try to
normalize psi, we'll

209
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:35,813
be normalizing middle
psi, as you will see here.

210
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:38,298
There's no need to put
that constant there.

211
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,789
So what do we get here?

212
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:44,759
We get integral dx
psi star of x and t,

213
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,910
so you have psi of x star.

214
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:56,242
And now you could say it's
E to the iEt over h-bar.

215
00:16:56,242 --> 00:16:59,090
That's the complex conjugate.

216
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,820
Now, on the other
hand, suppose--

217
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,535
I'll do this this way.

218
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:08,805
[INAUDIBLE] of
this other term is

219
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:14,935
psi of x into the
minus iEt over h-bar.

220
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,725
And now the good
thing about this, you

221
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:28,811
see this integral should be
normalized to 1 to make sense.

222
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:36,430
And it's a great thing that
the time dependence drops out.

223
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:41,114
And it would not have dropped
out if the energy had not

224
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:42,783
been real.

225
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:45,440
If the energy was
not real, I would

226
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,300
have had to put here E start.

227
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,180
And here I would have
had E star minus E

228
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,060
and some function of time.

229
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,660
And how can a function
of time be equal to 1?

230
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,180
Would be a problem.

231
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,720
We would not be able to
normalize this wave function.

232
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,165
So E must be real
because otherwise we

233
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:11,500
don't cancel this time
dependence, which happily,

234
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,920
when it cancels,
it just tells you

235
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:21,180
that the integral dx of
psi star of x psi of x

236
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:29,780
must be 1, which is
a very nice thing.

237
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,180
So in a stationary state,
the normalization condition

238
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,010
for a full time dependent
stationary state

239
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,416
is that the spacial
part is normalized.
