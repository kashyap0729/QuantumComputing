1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:06,990
PROFESSOR: We ask,
is psi of x, 0 real?

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,370
And I told you the answer is no.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,750
And how would I know
that this is not real?

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,240
Well, we can take the
complex conjugate.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,640
And at the end of the
day, this will boil down

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,524
to some property of phi of k.

7
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:30,160
You see, you have an expression
phi of x in terms of phi of k.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,150
So it would not be surprising
that the requirement

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,170
that psi is real means
something about phi of k.

10
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,210
So let's just say, suppose
psi is given by that,

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:50,950
then psi x, 0 star,
the complex conjugate

12
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:59,330
would be 1 over square root
of 2 pi integral phi of k star

13
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,930
e to the minus ikx dk.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,550
I conjugated everything in that
equation for psi of x and 0.

15
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:21,070
Now, you want to compare
this with psi of x and 0

16
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,480
to see if it's real.

17
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,320
Or let's consider what is the
condition that this be real.

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,500
So I want to simplify
here a little more.

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,420
So what I'm going to do is
going to change variables,

20
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,760
by changing k to minus k.

21
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,810
If you prefer to go
a little more slowly,

22
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,840
you could say you're
going to change k prime--

23
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,020
you're going to be a
new k, called k prime,

24
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,550
equals to minus k.

25
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,160
But it's possible
to do it this way.

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,600
Now, there's going to
be a couple of changes.

27
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,830
Wherever you see k, you're
now going to see minus k--

28
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:13,280
so 1 over 2 pi integral
phi of minus k.

29
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,670
And I'll just put this star
here, not so many parentheses--

30
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,730
e to the minus ikx becomes ikx.

31
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:29,630
And the dk will go to minus dk,
but the order of integration,

32
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,640
that was from minus infinity
to plus infinity, would switch.

33
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,580
So those two signs cancel.

34
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,200
So there's a sign from
doing dk to minus dk,

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,460
and 1 from the limit
of integration--

36
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,270
so at the end of the
day, you have dk,

37
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,755
and you still have this--

38
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:53,340
minus infinity to infinity.

39
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,420
And you can say, well,
is this equal to--

40
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:08,340
or what is the condition
of for psi to be real?

41
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:17,640
Well, is this equal to 1
over 2 pi minus phi of k, e

42
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,240
to the ikx dk--

43
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,100
is that-- question mark--
is that equal to it?

44
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,390
That would mean
that the psi of x, 0

45
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:39,810
is real, because this thing
is just psi of x and 0.

46
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,720
So this is a question
mark-- this is a condition.

47
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:53,980
So here you could say, exploring
the reality condition--

48
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:00,460
condition-- when
is a psi of x real?

49
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,460
So what must be true
is that these two terms

50
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,730
must equal each other.

51
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,280
So, in fact, this requires--

52
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:19,850
reality requires that 1 over
square root of 2 pi integral

53
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:27,000
from minus infinity
to infinity phi of k

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:39,540
minus phi star of minus k, e
to the ikx dx is equal to 0.

55
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,860
I brought the two
terms to one side.

56
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,210
Both are of the same type--

57
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,520
they're integrated
against an e to the ikx.

58
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,220
And therefore, we
can combine them,

59
00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:00,540
and that's what must be true
in order for the function

60
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,560
to be real.

61
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,340
And now you can
say, so what is it?

62
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,810
What's the answer?

63
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,685
Well, this integral
should vanish.

64
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,800
Now, this integral
should vanish--

65
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,290
it should vanish
for all values of k.

66
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,680
So actually, what
you want to conclude

67
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,440
is that this thing
is identically 0.

68
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,420
AUDIENCE: Excuse me, shouldn't
that be dk and not dx?

69
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,260
PROFESSOR: Yes, thank you.

70
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,290
Thanks very much.

71
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:48,760
So this property that this whole
integral be equal to 0, you

72
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,550
were tempted to
conclude that it means

73
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,810
that this thing is equal to 0.

74
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,640
And that is correct--

75
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,880
that is a perfectly
legal argument.

76
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:11,070
And it basically-- if you want
to express it more precisely,

77
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,420
you could base it on the
Fourier theorem, again.

78
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:21,240
These two sets of equalities
here are Fourier's theorem.

79
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,100
And look what this is saying--

80
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:30,770
this is saying that this
quantity has a 0 Fourier

81
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,660
transform.

82
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,400
Because how do you do
the Fourier transform

83
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,830
of a function of k?

84
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,820
You multiply by e to
the ikx and integrate.

85
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,640
And therefore, this function
has a 0 Fourier transform.

86
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,790
So, but if a function has
a 0 Fourier transform,

87
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,380
the function must be 0.

88
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,180
Because already this is
0, and the integral is 0--

89
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,610
0.

90
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:04,100
So this is absolutely rigorous.

91
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,520
And therefore, you
get the conclusion

92
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:21,670
that phi of minus k star
must be equal to phi of k,

93
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,695
and that's the
condition for reality.

94
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:35,340
So if a phi of k satisfies
this property, that psi of x

95
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,720
will be real, and our phi of k
doesn't satisfy this property,

96
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,690
what do you see
in this property?

97
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:49,380
Basically, if you have phi that
exists for some value of k,

98
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,640
it should also exist for
the value of minus k.

99
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,890
And in fact, should be
the complex conjugate

100
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,850
of the other value.

101
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:05,910
But here, you have some phis
of k, and no phis at minus k.

102
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:14,130
So the phi that we wrote above
doesn't satisfy this condition.

103
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,555
And therefore psi is not
real, and it all makes sense.

104
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:32,320
OK, so basically,
if you were plotting

105
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,299
not the absolute value,
but the real part

106
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,419
and the imaginary
parts of psi, you

107
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,290
would see some sort
of funny waves.

108
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,690
I think if you were plotting
the real part, for example,

109
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,780
you would see a wave like that.

110
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,710
And if you were plotting
the imaginary part,

111
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,700
you'd presumably see some
other wave like that.

112
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:09,440
And the absolute value,
it's much nicer and simpler.
