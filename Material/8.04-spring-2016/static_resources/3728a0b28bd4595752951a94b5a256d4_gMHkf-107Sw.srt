1
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:09,790
PROFESSOR: Square well.

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,260
So what is this problem?

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:17,110
This is the problem of having a
particle that can actually just

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:23,590
move on a segment, like it
can move on this eraser,

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,180
just from the left to the right.

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,110
It cannot escape here.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,860
So the way we represent
it is the interval 0

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,790
to a on the x-axis.

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:44,164
And there's going to be two
walls, one wall to the left

10
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:49,510
and one wall to the right,
and no potential in between.

11
00:00:49,510 --> 00:01:00,837
That is, I write the potential
V of x as 0, for x in between a

12
00:01:00,837 --> 00:01:09,190
and 0, and infinity for x
less than or equal to 0,

13
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,330
and x greater than
or equal to a.

14
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,120
So basically the particle
can move from 0 to a,

15
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,260
and nowhere else.

16
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,270
The potential is infinity.

17
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:35,680
Now, this problem, meaning
that the wave function--

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,470
the particle cannot be
outside the interval,

19
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,560
means that the wave
function must vanish outside

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,400
the interval.

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,530
And you could say,
how do you know?

22
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,800
Well, if the potential is close
to infinite amount of energy

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,150
to be there, so the particle
cannot really be there

24
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,585
if it's really infinite
energy that you need.

25
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:02,530
You will see in the finite
square well that the particle

26
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,870
has probability to be in regions
where it classically cannot be.

27
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,970
But that probability will go to
0 if the potential is infinite.

28
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,370
So we can think of it as a limit
and we will reconfirm that.

29
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,710
But in fact, if the
potential is infinity,

30
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:29,020
we will take it to mean that
psi of x is equal to 0 for x

31
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,715
less than 0 and for
x greater than a.

32
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,330
I am putting this equals or--

33
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,560
there are many
ways of doing this.

34
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,250
If this function,
as this continues,

35
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,550
you have a wall at a,
is the potential 0 at a

36
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,820
or is it infinity?

37
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,860
Well it doesn't quite matter.

38
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,560
The issue is that the
wave function is 0 here,

39
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,620
is 0 there, and we've
said that the wave

40
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,720
function must be continuous.

41
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,650
So it should be 0 by that
time you're at 0 or at a.

42
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:17,645
So therefore we will
take psi of 0 to be 0,

43
00:03:17,645 --> 00:03:22,600
and psi of a to be
0 by continuity.

44
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:38,570
So we discuss why the wave
function has to be continuous.

45
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,140
If the wave function
is not continuous,

46
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,480
the second derivative
of the wave function

47
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,510
is terribly singular.

48
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,490
It's like a derivative of
a delta function, which

49
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,910
is an impossible situation.

50
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,070
So the wave function,
we will take

51
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,860
it to vanish at
these two places,

52
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,260
and this is what is
called a hard wall.

53
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,960
So what is the
Schrodinger equation?

54
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,745
The Schrodinger equation is,
again, a free Schrodinger

55
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:15,460
equation.

56
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,300
Nothing, no potential here,
so it's the same Schrodinger

57
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:29,790
equation we had there, psi
double prime equals minus 2mE

58
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:35,180
over h squared, psi of x.

59
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:41,870
Or, again, minus k
squared psi of x.

60
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,890
Let's solve this.

61
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,070
So how do we do it?

62
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,130
Well it's, again, a
very simple equation,

63
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,900
but this time it's
conveniences--

64
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,150
we don't have a
circle or periodicity

65
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,890
to use sines and cosines.

66
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:08,050
So I'll take psi of x
to be c1 cosine of kx

67
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,420
plus c2 sine of kx.

68
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,310
But the wave function
must vanish at 0.

69
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,640
And at 0, the cosine
is 1, so you get c1.

70
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,830
And the sine is 0, so this
must be 0, so c1 is gone.

71
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,250
There's no c1 contribution
to the solution.

72
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:48,420
So psi of x is c2 sine of kx.

73
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,730
But we're not done.

74
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:58,130
We need this function to
vanish at the other side.

75
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:08,380
So psi of x equals a must
be 0, and that c2 sine of ka

76
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,366
must be 0.

77
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:16,980
And therefore we realize
that ka must be equal

78
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:27,970
to a multiple of pi because sine
vanishes for 0, pi, 2 pi, 3 pi,

79
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:33,445
minus pi, minus 2 pi, minus 3
pi, all the multiples of pi.

80
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:44,820
And therefore we will
write kn equals 2 pi n--

81
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,120
not 2 pi n.

82
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,750
Pi n over a.

83
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:04,550
OK, well, let me ask you,
what should we take for n?

84
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,900
All integers?

85
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,140
Should we skip some?

86
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,980
We took all integers
for the circle,

87
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,970
but should we take
all integers here?

88
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,400
So what happens
here, n equals 0.

89
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,980
What's the problem
with n equals 0?

90
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,640
n equals 0, k equals 0,
the wave function vanishes.

91
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,260
Well, wave function
vanishing is really bad

92
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,960
because there is
no particle then.

93
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,890
There is nowhere
in the probability

94
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,150
to find the particle.

95
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,302
So n equals 0 is not
allowed, for sure.

96
00:07:39,302 --> 00:07:44,290
n equals 0, no.

97
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,185
So why did we allow it, n
equals 0, in the circle?

98
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:53,590
In the circle for n equals 0,
exponential doesn't vanish.

99
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,605
It's a constant
and that constant

100
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:58,240
is a fine wave function.

101
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,360
0 is not fine, but
the constant is good.

102
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,150
But n equals 0 is not.

103
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:09,310
So how about positive
ends or negative ends.

104
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,690
And here comes the problem,
see we're getting to it.

105
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:21,820
For n equals minus
2 or for n equals 2.

106
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,050
So in one case, k is a number.

107
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:30,430
And in the other case, k is
the opposite sign number.

108
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:37,350
And sine of a number, or minus
a number, that number goes out.

109
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:47,350
So if you have a sine of minus
kx, that's minus sine of kx.

110
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,560
And two wave functions
that differ by a sign

111
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,040
are the same wave
function, physically.

112
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,240
There's nothing different.

113
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,030
They could differ by
an i and other things.

114
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:02,740
So when you pick
negative n minus 1,

115
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:08,090
or pick n equals plus 1, you
get the same wave function,

116
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,790
but just different by a sign.

117
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,360
So it's not new.

118
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,620
So in this case,
it's very interesting

119
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,060
that we must restrict ourselves.

120
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,930
We can correct all this
and just say n equals 1, 2,

121
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,238
3, all the way to infinity.

122
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,880
The wave function,
then, is psi n

123
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:44,140
of x, is proportional to
sine of n pi x over a.

124
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,250
And you look at it and you
say, yes, that looks nice.

125
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,170
For x equals 0, it vanishes.

126
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,800
For x equals a, it vanishes.

127
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,380
n and minus n would
give me the same wave

128
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,120
function up to a sine.

129
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,240
So this is good.

130
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,740
I just have to normalize it.

131
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:07,268
And normalizing it would be
done by putting an n here.

132
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:15,500
And then the integral psi n
squared dx from 0 to a only

133
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:24,130
would be n squared integral
from 0 to a dx of sine squared n

134
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,590
pi x over a.

135
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:38,160
Now, you can do this
integral by calculation.

136
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,950
And our sine squared
is written in terms

137
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:47,730
of a double angle cosine
of double angle plus a 1/2.

138
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,790
The intuition with
these things are

139
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:55,710
that if you're integrating
over the right interval that

140
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:04,710
contains an integer number of
cycles of the sine squared,

141
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,120
then the sine squared
has average 1/2.

142
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,240
Because sine squared plus
cosine squared is equal to 1.

143
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,040
So you don't have to do
the interval in general.

144
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,920
This is n squared times
1/2 times the length

145
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,790
of the interval, which is a.

146
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,885
And therefore n squared,
this is equal to 1,

147
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:32,820
and therefore n is equal
to square root of 2/a

148
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,320
and we can write
now our solutions.

149
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:48,770
Our solutions are m psi n
of x equals the square root

150
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:57,617
of 2/a sine n pi x over a.

151
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:03,030
And n equals 1,
2, up to infinity.

152
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:15,770
And En is equal to h
bar squared, k squared,

153
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:22,238
so pi squared, n
squared, a squared, to m.

154
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:34,080
That's it for the solutions of--

155
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,520
are there degeneracies?

156
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,140
No.

157
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,630
Every energy state is
different because there's

158
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,630
any single 1, 2, 3,
infinity, each one

159
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,930
has more energy than the next.

160
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:54,240
No, I'm sorry, the energy
increases as you increase n.

161
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,880
The energy levels actually
become more and more

162
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,780
spaced out.

163
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:04,230
And the last thing I
want to do with this box

164
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:09,420
is to look at the states and
see how they look and gather

165
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,540
some important
properties that are

166
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,130
going to be very relevant soon.
