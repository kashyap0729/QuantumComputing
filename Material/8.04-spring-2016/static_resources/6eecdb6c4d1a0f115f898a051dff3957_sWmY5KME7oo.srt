1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,240
PROFESSOR: So let's
do an example where

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,340
we can calculate
from the beginning

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,490
to the end everything.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,750
Now, you have to get
accustomed to the idea of even

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,270
though you can
calculate everything,

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,810
your formulas that you get
sometimes are a little big.

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,470
And you look at them
and they may not

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,370
tell you too much unless you
plot them with a computer.

9
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,570
So we push the calculations
to some degree,

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,990
and then at some
point, we decide

11
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:46,840
to plot things using a
computer and get some insight

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,750
on what's happening.

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,666
So here's the example.

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:01,850
We have a potential up
to distance, a, to 0.

15
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,750
The wall is always there, and
this number is minus v naught.

16
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:14,250
So it's a well,
a potential well.

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,140
And we are producing energy.

18
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,050
Eigenstates are coming here.

19
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:29,040
And the question now is to
really calculate the solution

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,020
so that we can really
calculate the phase shift.

21
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,720
We know how the
solutions should read,

22
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,840
but unless you do
a real calculation,

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,110
you cannot get the phase shift.

24
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,720
So that's what we want to do.

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,220
So for that, we have to solve
the Schrodinger equation.

26
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,710
Psi of x is equal to what?

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,870
Well, there's a discontinuity.

28
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,990
So we probably have to write
an answer in which we'll

29
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,420
have a solution in one piece and
a solution in the other piece.

30
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,479
But then we say, oh,
we wrote the solution

31
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,070
in the outside piece already.

32
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,090
It is known.

33
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,590
It's always the same.

34
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,670
It's universal.

35
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,340
I don't have to think.

36
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,890
I just write this.

37
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,990
E to the i delta.

38
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,980
I don't know what
delta is, but that's

39
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:33,080
the answer, E to the i delta
sine kx plus delta should

40
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,870
be the solution for
x greater than a.

41
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,640
You know if you were
not using that answer,

42
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,610
it has all the
relevant information

43
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,850
for the problem, time
delays, everything,

44
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,000
you would simply write
some superposition of E

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,790
to the i kx and E to the minus
i kx with two coefficients.

46
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:10,680
On the other hand, here, we
will have, again, a wave.

47
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,460
Now, it could be maybe
an E to the i kx or E

48
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,620
to the minus i kx.

49
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:23,640
Neither one is very good
because the wave function

50
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,080
must vanish at x equals 0.

51
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,070
And in fact, the k that
represents the kinetic energy

52
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:37,040
here, k is always related to
E by the standard quantity,

53
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,300
k squared equal to mE
over h squared or E equal

54
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,560
the famous formula.

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,340
On the other hand, there
is a different k here

56
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,880
because you have
different kinetic energy.

57
00:03:52,880 --> 00:04:02,200
There must be a k prime here,
which is 2m E plus v naught.

58
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,180
That's a total kinetic
energy over h squared.

59
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,195
And yes, the solutions
could be E to the ik prime

60
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:14,740
x equal to minus ik
prime x minus ik prime x,

61
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:20,769
but since they must vanish at
0, should be a sine function.

62
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,690
So the only thing
we can have here

63
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:33,650
is a sine of k prime x for x
less than a and a coefficient.

64
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,830
We didn't put the additional
normalization here.

65
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,810
We don't want to put
that, but then we

66
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,210
must put the number here,
so I'll put it here.

67
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,770
That's the answer, and
that's k and k prime.

68
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,320
Now we have boundary
conditions that x equals a.

69
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:04,780
So psi continues at x equals a.

70
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,060
What does it give you?

71
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:14,680
It gives you a sine of ka
is equal to E to the i delta

72
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,500
sine of ka plus delta.

73
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:27,020
And psi prime continues
at x equals a will give me

74
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:35,530
ka cosine ka equal--

75
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,800
I have primes missing;
I'm sorry, primes--

76
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:50,025
equals k E to the i delta
cosine ka plus delta.

77
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,640
What do we care for?

78
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,330
Basically we care for delta.

79
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,420
That's what we want to find
out because delta tells us

80
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,475
all about the physics
of the scattering.

81
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:12,690
It tells us about the scattering
amplitude, sine squared delta.

82
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:19,270
It tells us about the time
delay, and let's calculate it.

83
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,150
Well, one way to
calculate it is to take

84
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:28,360
a ratio of these two
equations so that you get rid

85
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,770
of the a constant.

86
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,710
So from that side
of the equation,

87
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:40,090
you get k cotangent
of ka plus delta

88
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:46,210
is equal to k prime
cotangent of k prime a.

89
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:58,660
Or cotangent of ka plus
delta is k prime over k.

90
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:04,130
We'll erase this.

91
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,700
And now you can do two things.

92
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,820
You can display some
trigonometric wizardry,

93
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:21,415
or you say, OK, delta is arc
cotangent of this minus ka.

94
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,670
That is OK, but it's not ideal.

95
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,860
It's better to do a little bit
of trigonometric identities.

96
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,140
And the identity
that is relevant

97
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:48,970
is the identity for cotangent of
a plus b is cot a cot b minus 1

98
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:54,760
over cot a plus cot b.

99
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:01,990
So from here, you have
that this expression

100
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:18,990
is cot ka cot delta minus 1
over cot ka plus cot delta.

101
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:27,430
And now, equating left-hand
side to this right-hand side,

102
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,870
you can solve for
cotangent of delta.

103
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,740
So cotangent of delta
can be solved for--

104
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,230
and here is the answer.

105
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:48,180
Cot delta is equal to tan
ka plus k prime over k cot k

106
00:08:48,180 --> 00:09:00,260
prime a over 1 minus k prime
over k cot k prime a tan ka.

107
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:07,460
Now, who would box such
a complicated equation?

108
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,361
Well, it can't be
simplified any more.

109
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:10,860
Sorry.

110
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,640
That's the best we can do.
