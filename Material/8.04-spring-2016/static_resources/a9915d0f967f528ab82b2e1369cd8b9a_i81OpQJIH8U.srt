1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,250
PROFESSOR: Let me
demonstrate now

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:08,140
with plain doing the
integral that, really,

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,000
the shape of this wave is
moving with that velocity.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,510
So in order to do
that, I basically

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,510
have to do the integral.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,760
And of course, if it's a general
integral, I cannot do it.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,870
So I have to figure out
enough about the integral.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,460
So here it is.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,729
We have psi of x and t.

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:41,670
It's integral dk phi of k e
to the ikx minus omega of kt.

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,530
OK.

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,350
It's useful for us to look
at this wave at time equals 0

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,560
so that we later compare it
with the result of the integral.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:08,030
So phi psi at time equals 0 is
just dk phi of k e to the ikx.

15
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,210
Only thing you know is that
phi has peaked around k0.

16
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,910
You don't know more than that.

17
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,020
But that's psi of x
and time equals 0.

18
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,490
Let's look at it later.

19
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,350
So we have this thing here.

20
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,900
And I cannot do the
integral unless I do some

21
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,430
approximations.

22
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,480
And I will approximate omega.

23
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:41,370
Omega of k, since we're anyway
going to integrate around k0,

24
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,020
let's do a Taylor series.

25
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:50,580
It's omega of k0 plus k
minus k0, the derivative

26
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:59,795
of omega with respect to k at k0
plus order k minus k0 squared.

27
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,382
So let's--

28
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,610
do this here.

29
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,480
So if I've expanded
omega as a function of k,

30
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,880
which is the only
reasonable thing to do.

31
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,110
k's near k0 are the only
ones that contribute.

32
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,550
So omega of k may be
an arbitrary function,

33
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,040
but it has a Taylor expansion.

34
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,160
And certainly, you've
noted that you get back

35
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,100
derivative that somehow
is part of the answer,

36
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,520
so that's certainly a bonus.

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,310
So now we have to plug
this into the integral.

38
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,340
And this requires a
little bit of vision

39
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,820
because it suddenly seems
it's going to get very messy.

40
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,330
But if you look at
it for a few seconds,

41
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,930
you can see what's going on.

42
00:02:52,930 --> 00:03:02,810
So psi of x and t, so far,
dk phi of k e to the ikx.

43
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,550
So far so good.

44
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:13,280
I'll split the exponential so
as to have this thing separate.

45
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,790
Let's do this. e to the minus i.

46
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,910
I should put omega of k times t.

47
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,780
So I'll begin.

48
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,230
Omega of k0 times t.

49
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,900
That's the first factor.

50
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,800
e to the minus i,
the second factor.

51
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,500
k--

52
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:36,370
k d omega dk.

53
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,990
k0 times t.

54
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,780
And the third factor is
this one with the k0.

55
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,972
e to the minus-- it
should be e to the plus.

56
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:56,286
i k not d omega dk.

57
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:58,890
k0 t.

58
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,900
Plus order--

59
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,490
higher up.

60
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,946
So e to the negligible--

61
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,100
negligible until you
need to figure out

62
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,140
distortion of wave patterns.

63
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,360
We're going to see
the wave pattern move.

64
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,070
If you want to see
the distortion,

65
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,620
you have to keep
that [INAUDIBLE].

66
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,390
We'll do that in
a week from now.

67
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,020
This is the integral.

68
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,340
And then, you probably
need to think a second.

69
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,880
And you say, look.

70
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,590
There's lots of things making it
look like a difficult integral,

71
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,640
but it's not as
difficult as it looks.

72
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,485
First, I would
say, this factor--

73
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,650
doesn't depend on k.

74
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,080
It's omega evaluated at k0.

75
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,210
So this factor is
just confusing.

76
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,780
It's not-- doesn't
belong in the integral.

77
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,170
This factor, too.

78
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,820
k0 is not a function of k.

79
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,890
d omega dk evaluated at
k0 is not a function of k.

80
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,350
So this is not really
in the integral.

81
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,150
This is negligible.

82
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,910
This is in the integral
because it has a k.

83
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,230
And this is in the integral.

84
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:26,310
So let me put here, e to
the minus i omega of k0 t

85
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,140
e to the minus--

86
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,370
to the plus i k0 d omega dk--

87
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,610
at k0 t.

88
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,740
Looks messy.

89
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,890
Not bad.

90
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,240
dk.

91
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,525
And now I can put phi of k.

92
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:58,190
e to the i k x minus
these two exponentials,

93
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:05,630
d omega dk at k0 times t.

94
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,820
And I ignore this.

95
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,060
So far so good.

96
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:21,530
For this kind of wave, we
already get a very nice result

97
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,535
because look at this thing.

98
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,190
This quantity can be written
in terms of the wave function

99
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,670
at time equals 0.

100
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,920
It's of the same
form at 5k integrated

101
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,550
with ik and some
number that you call x,

102
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,150
which has been changed to this.

103
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,320
So to bring in this and to
make it a little clearer--

104
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,770
and many times it's useful.

105
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,680
If you have a
complex number, it's

106
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,510
a little hard to see the bump.

107
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,199
Because maybe the bump
is in the real part

108
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,490
and not in the imaginary
part, or in the imaginary part

109
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,140
and not in the real part.

110
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:12,470
So take the absolute value,
psi of x and t, absolute value.

111
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,100
And now you say, ah, that's why.

112
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,350
This is a pure phase.

113
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,160
The absolute value of
a pure phase is that.

114
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,140
So it's just the absolute value
of this one quantity, which

115
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:41,015
is the absolute value of psi at
x minus d omega dk k0 t comma

116
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:41,515
0.

117
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,375
So look what you've proven.

118
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,310
The wave function-- the
norm of the wave function--

119
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,720
or the wave.

120
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,910
The new norm of the
wave at any time t

121
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,930
looks like the
wave looked at time

122
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,280
equals 0 but just
displaced a distance.

123
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:15,640
If there was a peak at x
equals 0, at time equals 0.

124
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:22,790
If at time equals 0, psi had a
peak when x is equal to zero,

125
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,460
it will have a peak--

126
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,010
This function, which is the
wave function at time equals 0,

127
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,220
will have a peak when this
thing is 0, the argument.

128
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:39,169
And that corresponds to x
equals to d omega dk times t,

129
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:46,300
showing again that the wave has
moved to the right by d omega

130
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,020
dk times t.

131
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,890
So I've given two
presentations, basically,

132
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,180
of this very important
result about wave packets

133
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,930
that we need to understand.
