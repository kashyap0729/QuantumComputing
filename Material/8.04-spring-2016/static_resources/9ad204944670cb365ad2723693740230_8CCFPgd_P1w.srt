1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,449
PROFESSOR: SHO algebraically.

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:17,300
And we go back to the
Hamiltonian, p squared over 2m

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:23,988
plus 1/2 m omega
squared x hat squared.

4
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,430
And what we do is observe
that this some sort

5
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:45,550
of sum of squares plus
p squared over m--

6
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:53,615
p squared over m
squared omega squared.

7
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,540
So the sum of two
things squared.

8
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:12,740
Now, the idea that
we have now is

9
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,652
to try to vectorize
the Hamiltonian.

10
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:25,970
And what we call vectorizing is
when you write your Hamiltonian

11
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:33,410
as the product of two vectors,
V times W. Well actually,

12
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,330
that's not quite
the vectorization.

13
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:42,510
You want kind of the same
vector, and not even that.

14
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:48,365
You sort of want this to be the
Hermitian conjugate of that.

15
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:52,970
And if there is a
number here, that's OK.

16
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:58,220
Adding numbers to a Hamiltonian
doesn't change the problem

17
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,380
at all.

18
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,250
The energies are all
shifted, and it's

19
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,920
just how you're defining
the zero of your potential,

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,850
is doing nothing but that.

21
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:14,860
So vectorizing the Hamiltonian
is writing it in this way,

22
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:22,580
as V dagger V. And you
would say, why V dagger V?

23
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,180
Why not VV dagger or VV
or V dagger V dagger?

24
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,640
Well, you want the
Hamiltonian to be Hermitian.

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,730
And this thing is Hermitian.

26
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,532
You may recall that AB dagger.

27
00:02:40,532 --> 00:02:45,880
The Hermitian conjugate of AB
dagger is B dagger A dagger.

28
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:51,895
So the Hermitian
conjugate of this product

29
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:56,940
is V dagger times the
dagger of V dagger.

30
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,390
A dagger of a dagger is the same
operator, when you dagger it

31
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,040
twice, you get the same.

32
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,260
So this is Hermitian.

33
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,420
V dagger times V is
a Hermitian operator,

34
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,440
and that's a very good thing.

35
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,520
And there will be
great simplifications.

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,830
If you ever succeed in writing
a Hamiltonian this way,

37
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:27,130
you've gone 90% of the way
to solving the whole problem.

38
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,510
It has become infinitely easier,
as you will see in a second,

39
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,910
if you could just write
this vectorization.

40
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:43,220
So if you had x minus--

41
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,050
x squared minus this, you
would say, oh, clearly that's--

42
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,230
A squared minus B squared
is A minus B time A plus B,

43
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,440
but there's no such thing here.

44
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,660
It's almost like A
squared plus B squared.

45
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,230
And how do you sort
of factorize it?

46
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,450
Well, actually, since
we have complex numbers,

47
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:10,460
this could be A minus
IB times A plus IB.

48
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,540
That is correctly A
squared plus B squared,

49
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,130
and complex numbers are supposed
to be friends in quantum

50
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:30,670
mechanics, so having Is, there's
probably no complication there.

51
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,370
So let's try that.

52
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,280
I'll write it.

53
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:41,220
So here we have x
squared plus p squared

54
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,720
over m squared omega squared.

55
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:52,232
And I will try to write it as
x minus i p hat over m omega

56
00:04:52,232 --> 00:04:59,030
times x plus I p
hat over m omega.

57
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,390
Let's put the question
mark before we

58
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,015
are so sure that this works.

59
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,100
Well, some things work.

60
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,720
The only danger here is
that these are operators

61
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,910
and they don't commute.

62
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:24,120
And when we do this, in one
case, in the cross-terms,

63
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,995
the A is to the left of B,
but the other problem the B

64
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,970
is to the left of A. So we
may run into some trouble.

65
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,810
This may not be exactly true.

66
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,125
So what is this?

67
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:43,300
This x with x, fine.

68
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,930
x squared.

69
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,320
This term, p with ps, correct.

70
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,410
Plus p squared over m
squared omega squared.

71
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:59,540
But then we get
plus i over m omega,

72
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:08,740
x with p minus p with x,
so that x, p commutator.

73
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,490
So vectorization of operators
in quantum mechanics

74
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,600
can miss a few concepts
because things don't commute.

75
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,310
So the cross-terms
give you that,

76
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:30,500
and this x, p is I h bar, so
this whole term will give us

77
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,010
the following statement.

78
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:45,710
What we've learned is
that what we wanted,

79
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:52,990
x squared plus p
squared over m squared

80
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,910
omega squared is equal to--

81
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:03,250
so I'm equating this
line to the top line--

82
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:10,990
is equal to x hat minus i
p hat over m omega times

83
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:16,150
x hat plus i p hat over m omega.

84
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:27,040
And then, from this whole
term, i with i is minus,

85
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,290
so it's h bar over m omega.

86
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,521
So I'll put it in--

87
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:39,400
it's a minus h bar
over m, [INAUDIBLE].

88
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:46,650
So here is plus h bar
over m omega times

89
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,030
a unit vector, if you wish.

90
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:55,855
OK.

91
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,950
So this is very good.

92
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:14,150
In fact, we can call this
V dagger and this V. Better

93
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,150
call this V first
and then ask, what

94
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,640
is the dagger of this operator?

95
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,250
Now, you may remember that,
how did we define daggers?

96
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:29,010
If you have phi with psi
and the inner product--

97
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,920
with an integral
of five star psi--

98
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,280
if you have an A
psi here, that's

99
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,710
equal to A dagger phi psi.

100
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,810
So an operator is acting
on the second wave

101
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,030
function, moves as A dagger
into the first wave function.

102
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:56,640
And you know that x moves
without any problem.

103
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,020
x is Hermitian.

104
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,730
We've discussed that p
is Hermitian as well,

105
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,240
moves to the other side.

106
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,540
So the Hermitian
conjugate of this operator

107
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,460
is x, the p remains means p,
but the i becomes minus i.

108
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,780
So this is correct.

109
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,280
If this second
operator is called V,

110
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,310
the first operator should
be called V dagger.

111
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,680
That is a correct statement.

112
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,880
One is the dagger
of the other one.

113
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:37,400
So the Hamiltonian
is 1/2 m omega

114
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,940
squared times this
sum of squares,

115
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:51,130
which is now equal to V dagger
V plus h bar over m omega.

116
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,730
So h hat is now
1/2 m omega squared

117
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:11,100
V dagger V plus a sum, which
is plus 1/2 h bar omega.

118
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,850
So we did it.

119
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:23,400
We vectorized the
Hamiltonian V dagger V,

120
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,510
and this is quite useful.

121
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:34,360
So the Vs, however, have units.

122
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,300
And you probably are aware that
we like things without units,

123
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,440
so that we can see
the units better.

124
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,410
This curve is perfectly nice.

125
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,620
It's a number added
to the Hamiltonian.

126
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,780
It's h omega, it
has units of energy,

127
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,370
but this is still
a little messy.

128
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:59,810
So let's try to clean up those
Vs, and the way I'll do it

129
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,631
is by computing their
commutator, to begin with.

130
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:15,520
So let's compute the
commutator of V and V dagger

131
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,312
and see how much
is that commutator.

132
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,360
It's a simple commutator,
because it involves vectors

133
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,040
of x and V. So
it's the commutator

134
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:39,180
of x plus ip over
m omega, that's V,

135
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,537
with x minus ip over m omega.

136
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:54,110
So the first x talks
only to the second piece,

137
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:59,200
so it's minus i
over m omega x, p.

138
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,970
And for the second
case, you have plus

139
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,180
i over am omega p with x.

140
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:20,960
This is i h bar, and
this is minus i h bar.

141
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,050
Each term will contribute
the same, i times minus i

142
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:32,610
is plus, so h bar over
and, omega times the 2.

143
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:40,340
That is V dagger V.
VV dagger, I'm sorry.

144
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,512
2 h bar over m omega.

145
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:52,040
So time to change
names a little bit.

146
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,980
Let's do the following.

147
00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:01,880
Let's put square root of
m omega over 2 h bar V.

148
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,971
Have a square root of m
omega over 2 h bar V dagger,

149
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:09,740
commute to give you 1.

150
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,190
That's a nice commutator.

151
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,206
It's one number-- or an
operator is the same thing.

152
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,470
So I brought the square
root into each one.

153
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,810
And we'll call the first term--

154
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,940
because of reasons
we'll see very soon--

155
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:43,560
the destruction operator, A
square root of m omega over 2 h

156
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:50,438
bar V. It's called the
destruction operator.

157
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:54,560
And the dagger is
going to be A dagger.

158
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,360
Some people put hats on them.

159
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,810
I sometimes do too,
unless I'm too tired.

160
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,370
2h bar V dagger.

161
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,600
And those A and A daggers
are now unit-free--

162
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,420
and you can check That--

163
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,570
Because they have
the same units.

164
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:23,890
And A with A dagger is
the nicest commutator, 1.

165
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,880
Is A a Hermitian operator?

166
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,150
Is it?

167
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,060
No.

168
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,410
A is not Hermitian.

169
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,820
A dagger is different from
A. A is basically this thing,

170
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,400
A dagger is this thing.

171
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,350
So not Hermitian.

172
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,204
So we're going to work
with these operators.

173
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:53,120
They're non-Hermitian.

174
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,900
I need to write the
following equations.

175
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,080
It's very-- takes a
little bit of writing,

176
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,370
but they should be
recorded, they will always

177
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,000
make it to the formula sheet.

178
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,770
And it's the basic relation
between A, A dagger, and x

179
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:16,110
and p.

180
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,160
A is this, A
dagger, as you know,

181
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,760
is x minus ip hat over m omega.

182
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,410
Since I'm copying, I'd
better copy them right.

183
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,150
x, on other hand,
is the square root

184
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:39,190
of h bar over 2m
omega A plus A dagger,

185
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:48,320
and p is equal to i square
root of m omega h bar over 2

186
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,844
A dagger minus A.

187
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,460
So these four equations,
A and A dagger

188
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:02,390
in terms of x and p and
vice versa, are important.

189
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,870
They will show up all the time.

190
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,470
Here are the things to notice.

191
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,290
A and A dagger is
visibly clear that

192
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,830
on is the Hermitian
conjugate of the other.

193
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,055
Here, x is Hermitian.

194
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:20,950
And indeed, A plus A
dagger is Hermitian.

195
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,780
When you do the Hermitian
conjugate of A plus A dagger,

196
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,460
the first A becomes an A dagger.

197
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,970
The second A, with another
Hermitian conjugation,

198
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,110
becomes A. So this is Hermitian.

199
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,100
But p is Hermitian, and here we
have A dagger minus A. This is

200
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,140
not Hermitian, it changes sign.

201
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:46,560
Well, the i is there for that
reason, and makes it Hermition.

202
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,870
So there they are, they're
Hermitian, they're good.
