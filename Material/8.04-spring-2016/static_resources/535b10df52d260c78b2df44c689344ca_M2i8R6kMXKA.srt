00:00:00,886 --> 00:00:04,971
PROFESSOR: How about
the expectation value

2
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:09,329
of the Hamiltonian in
a stationary state?

3
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:11,370
You would imagine,
somehow it has

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,520
to do with energy ion
states and energy.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,370
So let's see what happens.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,100
The expectation value
of the Hamiltonian

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,610
on this stationary state.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:31,056
That would be integral
dx stationary state

9
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:35,980
Hamiltonian stationary state.

10
00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:42,630
And we're going to see
this statement that we made

11
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,146
a few minutes ago become clear.

12
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:50,505
Well what do we get
here? dx psi star

13
00:00:50,505 --> 00:01:00,415
of x e to the i Et over
h bar H e to the minus i

14
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:06,394
Et over h bar psi of x.

15
00:01:06,394 --> 00:01:13,290
And H hat couldn't care less
about the time dependence,

16
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,820
that exponential is
irrelevant to H hat.

17
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,630
That exponential of time can be
moved across and cancelled with

18
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,150
this one.

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,555
And therefore you
get that this is

20
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:37,898
equal to dx psi star of x H hat
psi of x, which is a nice thing

21
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,722
to notice.

22
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:44,800
The expectation value of H
on the full stationary state

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,050
is equal to the
expectation value of H

24
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,816
on the spatial part of
the stationary state.

25
00:01:52,816 --> 00:01:54,760
That's neat.

26
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,802
I think it should be noted.

27
00:01:56,802 --> 00:02:03,350
So it's equal to the
H of little psi of x.

28
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,970
But this one, we can
evaluate, because if we

29
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:13,884
are in a stationary state, H hat
psi of x is E times psi of x.

30
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:17,250
So we get an E
integral the x psi

31
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,340
star of psi, which
we already show

32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,950
that integral is equal to
one, so we get the energy.

33
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,280
So two interesting things.

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,950
The expectation value
of this quantity

35
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,590
of H in the stationary
state is the same

36
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,110
as it's quotation value
of H in the spatial part,

37
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,724
and it's manually
equal to the energy.

38
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:59,700
By the way, you know, these
states are energy eigenstates,

39
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:06,090
these psi of x's, so you
would expect zero uncertainty

40
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,120
because they are
energy eigenstates.

41
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,815
So the zero uncertainty of the
energy operator in an energy

42
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:15,757
eigenstate.

43
00:03:15,757 --> 00:03:20,460
There's zero uncertainty even
in the whole stationary state.

44
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:28,705
If you have an H squared here,
it would give you an E squared,

45
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:32,860
and the expectation
value of H is equal to E,

46
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,610
so the expectation value of H
squared minus the expectation

47
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,480
value of H squared
would be zero.

48
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,595
Each one would be
equal to E squared.

49
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:47,780
Nothing would happen, no
uncertainties whatsoever.

50
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:55,820
So let me say once
more, in general, being

51
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:02,298
so important here is the
comment that the expectation

52
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:18,270
value of any time independent
operator, so comments 1,

53
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:30,965
the expectation value of any
time-independent operator

54
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:44,000
Q in a stationary state
is time-independent.

55
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,646
So how does that go?

56
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:51,062
It's the same thing.

57
00:04:51,062 --> 00:04:56,600
Q hat on the psi of
x and t is general,

58
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:07,069
now it's integral dx capital Psi
of x and t Q hat psi of x and t

59
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:12,162
equals integral dx-- you have to
start breaking the things now.

60
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:18,206
Little psi star of x E
to the i et over H bar.

61
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:20,540
And I'll put the
whole thing here.

62
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:27,910
Q hat Psi of x E to
the minus i et over H.

63
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,330
So it's the same thing.

64
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:40,700
Q doesn't care about time So
this factor just moves across

65
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,904
and cancels this factor.

66
00:05:44,904 --> 00:05:47,700
The time dependence
completely disappears.

67
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,843
And in this case,
we just get-- this

68
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:59,702
is equal to integral dx psi star
Q psi, which is the expectation

69
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:07,270
value of Q on little psi
of x, which is clearly

70
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,730
time-independent, because
the state has no time anymore

71
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,900
and the operator has no time.

72
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:22,180
So everybody loves their
time and we're in good shape.

73
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,792
The second problem is
kind of a peculiarity,

74
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:30,506
but it's important to
emphasize superposition.

75
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:33,910
It's always true,
but the superposition

76
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:40,940
of two stationary states is
or is not a stationary state?

77
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,844
STUDENT: No.

78
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:43,080
PROFESSOR: No, good.

79
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,720
It's not a stationary
state in general

80
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,110
because it's not factorizing.

81
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,010
You have two stationary states
with different energies,

82
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,408
each one has its
own exponential,

83
00:06:58,408 --> 00:07:02,510
and therefore, the whole
state is not factorized

84
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,050
between space and time.

85
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,328
One time-dependence has one
space-dependence plus another

86
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,202
time-dependence and
another space-dependence,

87
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:13,000
you cannot factor it.

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,740
So it's not just a plain fact.

89
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:29,446
So the superposition of
two stationary states

90
00:07:29,446 --> 00:07:39,924
of different energy
is not stationary.

91
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:51,310
And it's more than just saying,
OK, it's not stationary.

92
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,310
What it means is that if
you take the expectation

93
00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,690
value of a
time-independent operator,

94
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,740
it may have time-dependence,
because you are not anymore

95
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,222
guaranteed by the
stationary state

96
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:10,630
that the expectation value
has no time-dependence.

97
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:16,850
That's how, eventually, these
things have time-dependence,

98
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,620
because these things
are not [INAUDIBLE]

99
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,250
on stationary states.

100
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,302
On stationary
states, these things

101
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:27,694
would have no time-dependence.

102
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:31,500
And that's important,
because it would

103
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,740
be very boring,
quantum mechanics,

104
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,429
if expectation
values of operators

105
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,419
were always time-independent.

106
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,515
So what's happening?

107
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:42,616
Whatever you measure never
changes, nothing moves,

108
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:44,590
nothing changes.

109
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,500
And the way it's
solved is because you

110
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,100
do have those stationary
states that will give you

111
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,674
lots of solutions.

112
00:08:51,674 --> 00:08:53,790
And then we combine them.

113
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,640
And as we combine them,
we can get time-dependence

114
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,290
and we can get the most
[INAUDIBLE] equation.
